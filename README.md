# TheRedditCase

This project uses subreddit /r/subreddit.json to fetch the data and displaying the entries.

User can:
- View list of posts
- View individual post by clicking on title or 'read more' button
- Change the number of posts per page by 5, 10 and 25 (10 by default)
- Paginate using previous/next buttons

Selftext is rarely available, when it is, it's displayed, otherwise placeholder text is shown.

Live demo is available [here](https://namelessunknown.github.io/TheRedditCase/)
